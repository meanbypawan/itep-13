             }

 Q.2 How Browser Execute Javascript Code         
 Answer :-   Javascript Code ---> Parsing
                                |-- Lexical Analysis [Tokenization]
                                |-- Syntax Analysis [AST [Abstract Syntax Tree]]  
            AST-----> Iginition-Interpreter----ByteCode ---------> Execute
                                        |
                         If there is need of optimization
                                        |
                                 Turbofan Compiler
                                 
            Execution :-
               It will activate the call stack
               Inside call stack global execution context will be created
               Execution Contect has 2-components [Memory & Code Component]
               It will execute code line by line
               If there is any function call then seperate execution context will be created    
                   
                   
                                                               
            function add(a,b){
             console.log(a);
             console.log(b);
             let c = a + b;
             console.log("Addition : "+c); 
            }
  4. What is DOM ?
  Answer :- It stands for Doucment Object Model
           It helps convert html into dhtml
           Provide library to manipulate html elements
           Allows us to perfrom some operation in html page.
  
  5.   How peform click event on DOM element using javascript ?
  Answer :-  <button id="btn" onclick="handleClick()">ClickMe</button>
            
            let btnObj = document.getElementById("btn");
            btnObj.addEventListener("click",function(){
            
            });
  6. Explain alert() and confirm()
  7. Difference Between Undefined and null      

     undefined :- 
       var x; // undefined
       var x = undefined;

      1.If variable is decleared but not initialized.
      2.Type of undefined value is undefined
      3. 20 + undefined , 20 * undefined ===> NaN
      4. undefined == null => true, undefined === null ==> false
      5. undefined can not be used in json
     null :- 
     1. Need to assign null              
     2. Type of null is object.      
     3. 20 + null = 20 , 20 * null = 0    
     4. null can be used in json
  8. What is function in Javascript ? can we overload the function in js ?
 Answer :- It is block of code .
           Give us modular approach
           Make Trouble shooting easy
           Help in code reusability
           Manage Code redundancy.
        In Javascript we can not overload the function.   
         
  9. Function Statement v/s Function Expression
  Answer :-
      Function Statement :-
      ------------------------------------------------
      function add(){
        console.log("Function Statement...");
      }
      1. It is hoisted
      ---------------------------------------------------
      Function Expression :-
      var add = function(){
        console.log("Function Expression....");
      }
      1. It is not hoisted
      ------------------------------------------------------
  normal function[function keyword] v/s Arrow function
  In arrow function this will refer it's global context
  but in normal function this will refere current context.        

Q11. What is callback ? Explain with suitable example.
Answer :- Callback is a function which passed as a argument ot another function and
supposed to executed later.
It is used to handle asynchronous operation in javascript .

For Example :-
function sayHello(){
  console.log("Hello Students..");
}
setTimeout(sayHello,5000);

         
Q12. What is Closoure ?
Answer :-

Q. var v/s let v/s const

var :- it is hoisted can be used before declaration.
2. in case var , we can redefine the variable.
   var x = 100;
   var x = "Hello"
3. var is function scopic.

let :- It is also hoisted but enter in temporal deadzone.
2. We cannot redefine the variable
3. Block Scopic
const :- It is also hoisted but enter in temporal deadzone.
